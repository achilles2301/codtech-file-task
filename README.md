# CodTech Internship – File Handling Task

This repo contains a small Java program that does basic file handling:

- Writes text to a file
- Reads that file and shows the content
- Modifies a specific line in the file

Tech used
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA (for writing and testing)

Files
- `FileOperations.java` – main Java file
- `example.txt` – sample file used for reading/writing

This was created as part of an internship task for CodTech IT.

Feel free to use or modify it. Just something simple and clean. :)
